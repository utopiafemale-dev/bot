# üîç How to Check Your PayPal Permissions - Step by Step

## üéØ **What You Need to Check:**
The 401 errors indicate your PayPal app permissions need verification. Here's exactly how to check them:

## üìã **Step-by-Step Permission Check:**

### **Step 1: Access PayPal Developer Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/
2. **Log in** with your PayPal account credentials
3. You should see your list of apps

### **Step 2: Find Your App**
Look for the app with these details:
- **Client ID**: `AVSVbuV65Ei6wU-QbQCYBj6RWvhxHGLEnKu-C7ccMMT8IRtVkPq8XqzfKcEroiesRKZTBeCLWxdYfJiv`
- **App Name**: Whatever you named it when you created it

### **Step 3: Check App Details**
1. **Click on your app name** to open the details
2. Look for the **"Features"** section
3. Check the status of these permissions:

#### **Required Permissions:**
- ‚úÖ **"Accept Payments"** - Should be enabled
- ‚úÖ **"Payouts"** - This is the critical one!

#### **Permission Status Meanings:**
- ‚úÖ **"Live"** or **"Approved"** = Ready to use for real money
- ‚è≥ **"Pending"** = Waiting for PayPal approval
- ‚ùå **"Not Requested"** = Need to enable it
- ‚ùå **"Denied"** = Need to reapply

### **Step 4: What to Look For**

#### **If Payouts Shows "Not Requested":**
1. Check the **"Payouts"** checkbox
2. Click **"Save"**
3. Wait 1-3 business days for approval

#### **If Payouts Shows "Pending":**
- This is normal - wait for PayPal approval
- Can take 1-3 business days
- You'll get an email when approved

#### **If Payouts Shows "Approved" or "Live":**
- Your permissions are correct!
- The 401 error might be due to expired credentials
- Try creating a new app with fresh credentials

### **Step 5: Check Sandbox vs Live**
Make sure you're looking at the **correct environment**:
- **Sandbox**: For testing (currently working in your system)
- **Live**: For real money (what you need for actual transfers)

Both environments have separate permission settings!

## üîß **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: Can't Find Your App**
- Make sure you're logged into the correct PayPal account
- Check both Sandbox and Live environments
- The app might be under a different PayPal account

### **Issue 2: Payouts Permission Missing**
- Enable "Payouts" in the Features section
- Submit for approval
- Wait 1-3 business days

### **Issue 3: Permission Denied**
- PayPal may require business verification
- Check your email for requests for additional documents
- Contact PayPal support if stuck

### **Issue 4: Credentials Expired**
- Even with correct permissions, credentials can expire
- Create a new app to get fresh credentials
- Update `config.js` with new Client ID and Secret
